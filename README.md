RuckZuck
========

## Synopsis

If you—like me– don't enjoy creating basic directory-structures
everytime you start a backbone.js based project you can use
RuckZuck to kickstart this structure and concentrate on your
actual code instead of boilerplate.

## Installation

	$ git clone git://github.com/alappe/RuckZuck.git
	$ cd RuckZuck
	$ npm link

Not yet but in the future you can use npm to install ruckzuck
globally:

`npm install -g ruckzuck`

## Usage

Kickstart a new project:

`ruckzuck --create --project <projectname>`

## TODOs

* Restructure code to make it readable
* Add tests to code
* Add ability to kickstart a model/view/collection
* Get rid of number-prefixed files and directories
* Add ability to use an environment variable to point to your own
  template path instead of mine
